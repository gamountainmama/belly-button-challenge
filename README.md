# belly-button-challenge

1. Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    - Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
    - Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
    - Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
    - Use otu_ids for the x values.
    - Use sample_values for the y values.
    - Use sample_values for the marker size.
    - Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
   -  Use otu_labels for the text values.
4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
6. Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
